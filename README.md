# lasso_ridge_regressor

Demostrated the Ridge and Lasso Regression with the help of the load_boson dataset.

Ridge and Lasso regression are used to reduce the cost function which inturn reduce the pheonomena of OverFitting od the data-points

The advantage of Lasso Regression is that it can be also used for the feature selection along with handling Over-Fitting. Because in Lasso Regression, the slope tends 
to become equal to zero. So, the features who are close to zero can be removed. Hence, it supports Feature Selection too!
